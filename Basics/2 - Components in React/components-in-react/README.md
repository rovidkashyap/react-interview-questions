# Difference Between Functional and Class Components

1. Functional Components

    - Functional components are simpler and written as JavaScript functions.

    - Prior to React 16.8, functional components were stateless and did not have lifecycle   methods. However, with the introduction of Hooks, functional components can now use state and other React features.

    - Functional components generally have a simpler and potentially more efficient structure since they are just plain JavaScript functions.

2. Class Components

    - Class components are defined using ES6 classes and extend from `React.Component`.

    - Class components can have their own state and lifecycle methods.

    - Class components can be more complex due to the need to manage `this` binding and lifecycle methods explicitly.


Overall, functional components with Hooks are now the preferred way to write components in modern React development.
