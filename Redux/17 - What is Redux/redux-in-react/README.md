Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It helps you manage the state of your application in a consistent way. Here's a high-level overview of Redux and how to integrate it with React.

## Core Concepts of Redux

1. **Store**: The single source of truth. The entire state of your application is stored in an object tree within a single store.

2. **Action**: A plain object that describes what happened. Actions are the only source of information for the store.

3. **Reducer**: A function that specifies how the state changes in response to an action. Reducers take the current state and an action as arguments and return a new state.

4. **Dispatch**: A method to send an action to the store.

5. **Selector**: A function that extracts a piece of state from the store.

## Integrating Redux with React

1. Install Redux and React-Redux

    ### You need to install Redux and React-Redux Libraries:
        - npm install redux react-redux

2. Create Actions

    - Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your Redux store.
    - check the file `action.js` for code.

3. Create Reducers

    - Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions.
    - check the file `reducer.js` for code.

4. Create Store

    - The store brings together the state, actions and reducers.
    - check the `store.js` file for code.

5. Provide the Store to React

    - Use the `Provider` component from React-Redux to pass the store to your React components.
    - check the `index.js` file for code.

6. Connect React Components to Redux Store

    - Use the `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks to interact with the Redux store.
    - Check the `Counter.js` file for code.

7. Use the Connected Component in your App.

    - Check the `App.js` file for code.


## Summary

1. **Store**: Holds the state of your application.

2. **Action**: Describe what happened.

3. **Reducer**: Handles state changes based on actions.

4. **Dispatch**: Sends actions to the store.

5. **Selector**: Extracts state from the store.
