Redux is built around three core principles that ensure predictable state management. These principles are:

## 1. Single Source of Truth

    - The entire state of your application is stored in a single JavaScript object called the "store." This centralizes the application's state, making it easier to manage and debug.

    **Advantages**:

        - Simplifies state management
        - Makes it easier to track changes and debug
        - Ensure consistency across the application

## 2. State is Read-Only

    - The only way to change the state is by dispatching an action. An action is a plain JavaScript object that describes what happened and must have a type property. This principle ensures that state changes are explicit and traceable, which helps in debugging and maintaining the application.

    **Advantages**:

        - Enforces unidirectional data flow.
        - Makes state transitions explicit and predictable.
        - Enhances debugging capabilities.

## 3. Changes are Made with Pure Functions

    - Reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action as arguments, and return a new state. They must be pure, meaning they should produce no side effects and return the same output for the same input.

    **Advantages**:

        - Ensures that state transitions are predictable.
        - Makes the application wasier to test.
        - Encourages immutability and functional programming practices.
