Redux Thunk is a middleware for Redux that allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. This function can then be used to perform asynchronous operations, such as API calls, or to dispatch multiple actions in sequence or conditionally.

## Why Use Redux Thunk?

Redux by itself is synchronous, meaning it can't handle asynchronous operations like API requests directly. Redux Thunk allows you to introduce asynchronous logic by writing action creators that return a function, giving you greater flexibility in handling complex workflows.

## How Redux Thunk Works

1. **Action Creator**: Instead of returning an action object, an action creator returns a function.

2. **Thunk Function**: The function can dispatch actions and perform asynchronous tasks.

3. **Dispatch**: The function receives the dispatch and getState functions as arguments, allowing it to dispatch actions and access the current state.
