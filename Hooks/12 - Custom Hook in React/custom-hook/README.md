Creating a custom hook in React allows you to encapsulate and reuse logic across multiple components. A custom hook is a JavaScript function whose name starts with use and that can call other hooks. 

Custom hooks follow the same rules as regular hooks, such as not being called conditionally and being called at the top level of a function.

## Steps to Create a Custom Hook

1. Define a function with a name starting with `use`.
2. Use built-in hooks within your custom hook to implement the desired logic.
3. Return the necessary state and functions from the custom hook.

## Example: Custom Hook for Fetching Data

Let's create a custom hook called `useFetch` that fetches data from an API.

## STEP 1: Define the Custom Hook
    - Create a new file named `useFetch.js`.

## Explaination:

1. **useState**: Initialize `data`, `loading`, and `error` state variables.

2. **useEffect**: Fetch data when the `url` changes.

3. **fetchData**: An async function that fetches data from the provided `url`, handles error, and updates state.

4. **Return Statement**: Return the `data`, `loading`, and `error` state variables from the custom hook.

## STEP 2: Use the Custom Hook in a Component
    - Now, let's use the `useFetch` custom hook in a component.

## Explaination:

1. **useFetch Hook**: Call the `useFetch` hook with the `url` prop to fetch data.

2. **Conditional Rendering**: Display loading, error, or data based on the state returned from the custom hook.

By Creating custom hooks, you can abstract away complex logic and promote code reuse, making your components cleaner and easier to manage.
